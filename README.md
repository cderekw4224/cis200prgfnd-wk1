# cis200prgfnd-wk1
Part 1:
For this lab, use Eclipse to edit, compile and run the program. Open Eclipse and, from scratch, create a
program to:
- Calculate the overall GPA for a student (round and display to two decimal places)
- Assume the user took four classes in the semester
- For each of the four classes (just copy & paste the steps below four times)
- Ask the user for the credit hours of the course
- Ask the user for the letter grade the received in the course
-Make sure your code works for upper- and lower-case letter grades
-Use constants for the point values for an A (4), B (3), C (2), D (1) and F (0).
Suggestion: Get your program working for a SINGLE course before you copy and paste … otherwise
you are copying and pasting errors!
To calculate the GPA:
A – 4 B – 3 C – 2 D – 1 F – 0
Ex: A student gets an A, C, D, and B is a 4, 3, 3, and 4-hour course, respectively:
(4*4) + (2*3) + (1*3) + (3*4) = 16+6+3+12 = 37 / 14 credit hours = 2.64 GPA

Part 2:
-Add a simple error check so only the grades listed above will be accepted (A, B, C, D, or F). Otherwise,
an error message is produced (“Invalid Grade”) and the program will exit.
(A Loop is NOT required but feel free to use one, if you are familiar with loops…then don’t exit but
loop until valid value is entered)
